# Predict the amount of rent

This project aims to demonstrate my skills in the R programming language.

By using that language.
 We will create a linear regression model in order to estimate the price of renting in Brazil.

The project is divided into 3.

* The first part is dedicated to data cleaning and feature engineering.

* The second is where we are going to preprocess the data and create the regression model. And evaluate their performance.

* Finally using the shiny library. Let's create an application.
  Make it easy for users to enter new data. For the algorithm to make predictions in real time.

**Note**

The first two steps will be presented in pdf format. So that you can see the graphs of the variables.

The city variable is 1 when the house is in a metropolis. Otherwise, it will put a 1.
